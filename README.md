#### __Monitoring of Temperature and Humidity (IoT)__
It is a project, whose objective is to monitor the environmental variables Temperature and Humidity, built with the following components:
  1. ESP8266 Microcontroller
  2. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
  3. Buzzer
  4. LEDs.
 
The Hardware part performs the service of reading the environmental data and makes it available on the Think to Speak Platform so that later A REST API application, built in Java, accesses this data and saves it in a database, as needed, and also provides more services for other web clients or mobile app.
