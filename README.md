Monitoring of Temperature and Humidity (IoT)
It is a project, whose objective is to monitor the environmental variables Temperature and Humidity, built with the following components:
  1- ESP8266 Microcontroller
  2- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
  3- Buzzer
  4- LEDs
The Hardware part performs the service of reading the environmental data and makes it available on the Think to Speak Platform so that later A REST API application, built in Java, accesses this data and saves it in a database, as needed, and also provides more services for other web clients or mobile app.
